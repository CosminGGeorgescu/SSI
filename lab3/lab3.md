    criptare: "HELLO" -> "KHOOR"

    decriptare: "HELLO" <- "KHOOR"

    smecherie: deplasam alfabetul cu 3 pozitii la stanga

    securitate: aproape non-existenta

    tehnici de spargere: brute-force (nu sunt asa  multe incercari)

alice and bob are the worlds most famous cryptographic couple. since
their invention in 1978, they have at once been called inseparable, and
have been the subject of numerous divorces, travels, and torments. in the
ensuing years, other characters have joined their cryptographic family.
theres eve, the passive and submissive eavedrropper, mallory the malicious
attacker, and trent, trusted by all, just to name a few. while alice, bob, and
their extended family were originally used to explain how public key
cryptography works, they have since become widely used across other
science and engineering domains. their influence continues to grow
outside of academia as well: alice and bob are now a part of geek lore, and
subject to narratives and visual depictions that combine pedagogy
with in-jokes, often reflecting of the sexist and heteronormative
environments in which they were born and continue to be used. more than
just the worlds most famous cryptographic couple, alice and bob have
become an archetype of digital exchange, and a lens through which to view
broader digital culture. q.dupont and a.cattapan cryptocouple
